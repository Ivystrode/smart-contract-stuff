# Components

### DappToken
This is the token that we give out to users who stake on our platform - our reward token

### TokenFarm
- stake tokens
- unstake tokens
- issue tokens- token rewards
- add allowed tokens to allow more tokens to be staked
- get ETH value of the underlying staked tokens

## Frameworks
- create-react-app
- UsaDapp.io

Also need 
- npx
- yarn

Using NPM is even worse than I remember. I had to use NVM to get the correct version working properly.

Repos often have a separete repo for the frontend - we are just making the same one this time...
